## Overview

This was a newbie challenge. I used vanilla HTML and CSS and did not go for the bonus js. My goal this time was to get more organized in the CSS and I looked into CUBE and BEM.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CUBE
- BEM

### What I learned

The plan was to map out the project a little better this time, and try to make the CSS more readable. To this end, I researched CUBE, BEM and the DRY (don't repeat yourself) conventions.

Filled in a few gaps in my skills. First time using @font-face import rule. Also first use of a variable font. Tried to add a box-shadow.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: hankenGrotesk;
  src: url(./assets/fonts/HankenGrotesk-VariableFont_wght.ttf);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to develop my organization of the CSS with CUBE, BEM and any other techniques. I am always looking to keep it DRY (don't repeat yourself.)

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0px6YH-cauQ&t=986) - This helped me with keeping it DRY. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Syal Infotainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyR6RXUZFQ8) - This is helped me finally understand BEM. There are many other videos on the subject, but I'd recommend this to anyone still learning this concept because it is concise and clear.
